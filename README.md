# How to synchronize trackball in multiple charts (SfCartesianChart)

In Flutter Cartesian Chart widget, you can synchronize the trackball of multiple charts using the available callback events and public methods. A callback event is a callback function or method, which you can pass as an argument to another function or method. It can perform an action when you require it, and public methods are methods that can be called by using the class object where they are defined. The callback event used for synchronizing trackball is the onChartTouchInteractionMove and the show public method of the trackball is used for activating the trackball in multiple charts in a synchronized fashion on user interaction.
